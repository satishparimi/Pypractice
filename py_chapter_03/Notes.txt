## Pytest Fixtures and scope
You can choose to parameterize fixtures and tests according to configuration and component options, or to re-use fixtures across class, module or whole test sessions scopes. These sessions are explained below:
We define scope in fixture. Scopes are of four types;
1. Function.
2. Class.
3. Module.
4. Session.

scope="function" - If we need to perform an action before and after of an function of a module we use function scope (scope=“function”)

scope="class" - If we need to perform an action before and after of an class of a module we use class scope (scope=“class”)

scope="module" - If we need to perform an action before and after of an module we use module scope (scope=“module”)

scope="session" - If we need to perform an action before and after for a set of methods in a folder or project we session scope (scope=“session”).
It creates single fixture for set of methods in a project or modules in some path.
